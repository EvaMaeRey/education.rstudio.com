title: Teaching A New Generation of R Users

RStudio's mission is to equip everyone, regardless of means, to participate in a global economy that rewards data literacy. RStudio's education team supports that mission with open-source educational materials that we believe will help train the next million R users around the world. 

However, we cannot do this alone; we also need teachers. R's popularity has fueled a booming market for those who can teach R to others. The following resources are aimed at those people. Some are designed specifically for academic teaching in a semester-long format and others for much shorter workshops. All of RStudio's resources are distributed under open-source licenses to encourage teachers to adapt and use these materials in their own ways.

Teaching R breaks down into three separable and learnable skills:

1. General teaching skills
1. How to use those skills to teach R and data science
1. How to set up computing infrastructure for teaching R and data science

We'll tackle these three topics independently.
