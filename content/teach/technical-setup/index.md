- **Use [RStudio Cloud in the Classroom](https://resources.rstudio.com/webinars/rstudio-cloud-in-the-classroom).** [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) is a managed cloud instance of the RStudio IDE. This means you and your learners can use the RStudio IDE directly from your browser - there is no software to install and nothing to configure on your computer. Using RStudio Cloud early in a workshop or course allows you to circumvent the installation step and skip right to the good stuff. This webinar walks you through the steps of setting up your course on RStudio Cloud, highlighting the various functionalities for teachers and students.

- **Craft your course infrastructure.** The article [_Infrastructure and tools for teaching computing throughout the statistical curriculum_](https://peerj.com/preprints/3181/) discusses computational infrastructure and toolkit choices for modern educators using RStudio Server and RStudio Server Pro. The authors provide links to technical notes on setting up these systems for teaching, intended for both academics and IT professionals.
