RStudio offers several resources to make it easier for you to teach R, ranging from semester-long courses to more intense workshops.

## Courses

Most teachers enjoy developing their own instruction materials, but the need for exercises, homework, exams, slides, and other supporting materials make this a big job. Below are some open source materials developed at RStudio and elsewhere that you can freely adapt and use for your R teaching.

- **Get a complete [data science course in a box](https://datasciencebox.org).** [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org) contains the complete materials for teaching a semester-long introductory data science course. The "box" contains materials for an undergraduate level introductory data science course, such as slide decks, homework assignments, guided labs, sample exams, a final project assignment, as well as materials for instructors such as pedagogical tips, information on computing infrastructure, technology stack, and course logistics. The [website](https://datasciencebox.org) exposes the source materials that live in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box) and use datasets from the [dsbox package](https://github.com/rstudio-education/dsbox).

- **Teach with [STAT 545](https://stat545.com/).**
Stat545 is a course in data wrangling, analysis, and exploration in R with RStudio. Although the course was designed as a graduate-level, semester-long introduction to data science by [Dr. Jennifer (Jenny) Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/), the free online materials Jenny developed have been a valuable resource for self-directed learners and other educators. The education team at RStudio has recently refreshed the course materials into an online book.

- **Use [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) in the classroom.** Many educators use the free online book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) as a course textbook. There is also an [R for Data Science Instructor's Guide](https://github.com/rstudio-education/r4ds-instructors), which contains notes for people teaching [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) with each chapter's learning objectives and key points. The "unofficial" [R4DS Solutions Manual](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/), a community resource developed by and for educators, is also helpful if you want to use R4DS in the classroom.

## Workshop Materials

Many of you may have taken workshops from the RStudio team, but did you know that all of RStudio's workshop materials are available for you to use in your own workshops? Below are a few of the more popular workshop respositories proven popular with teachers:
  
- [**Teach the Tidyverse.**](https://github.com/rstudio-education/master-the-tidyverse-instructors) [Master the Tidyverse](https://github.com/rstudio-education/master-the-tidyverse/) is an award-winning two-day introduction to doing data science with the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). This repository contains instructor materials (Keynote and PowerPoint slides) for teaching this workshop.

- [**Teach Shiny.**](https://github.com/rstudio-education/teach-shiny) This workshop is designed for those who want to up their teaching Shiny game, and is particularly aimed at training partners who want to qualify as an RStudio Certified Shiny Instructor and at those who are R and Shiny advocates in their organizations.

- [**Teach everything else!**](https://github.com/rstudio-education/) At the [RStudio Education GitHub Organization](https://github.com/rstudio-education/) instructors can find the materials for all workshops taught by the RStudio Education team. All of these workshop materials are openly-licensed and freely-available for reuse. Please follow the reuse guidelines outlined in the licenses in the specific repositories, and enjoy leveraging quality teaching materials designed and developed by our team!
