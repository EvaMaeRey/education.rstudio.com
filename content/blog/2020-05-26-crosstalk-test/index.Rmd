```{r}
library(crosstalk)
library(leaflet)
library(DT)

# Wrap data frame in SharedData
sd <- SharedData$new(quakes[sample(nrow(quakes), 10),])
```

# No bootstrap

The filtering works in only one direction: going from map -> DT, but not vice versa. And this one doesn't break my site's CSS.

```{r fig.show='hold', out.width='25%'}
leaflet(sd) %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(~long, ~lat)
datatable(sd)
```
