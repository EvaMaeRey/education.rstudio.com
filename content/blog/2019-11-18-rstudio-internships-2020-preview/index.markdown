We are pleased to announce that RStudio’s summer intern program will be run for a third time in 2020. 10 people who are full-time students at accredited institutions of higher education will have the chance to work with an RStudio mentor full-time for 12 weeks starting in May 2020.

The theme of this year’s program is learning: six of the interns will create new online lessons (which will be freely available for all to use under a Creative Commons license), while two others will work on supporting tools. An additional two interns will be embedded with our QA team to help extend and automate our testing processes. As in previous years, applicants must be US residents, but two of this year's places will be reserved specifically for undergraduates.

We will start taking applications at the beginning of January 2020; the final date to apply will be January 17, and we hope to interview and make offers before the end of February. Please keep an eye on this blog and on Twitter for details—we look forward to hearing from you.

## Lesson Developer

Tens of thousands of people have learned basics data science skills from RStudio’s cloud-based primers in class and on their own. In this project, you will work with a member of RStudio’s education team to develop primers on new topics, such as statistical modeling, Shiny, or publishing with R Markdown. Successful candidates will be comfortable programming in R using the RStudio IDE, familiar with the R Markdown toolchain, and enjoy writing and teaching. To demonstrate these skills and your ability to work with Git and GitHub, your application needs to include a link to a package, Shiny app, or data analysis repository on GitHub. It's OK if you create something specifically for this application: we just want to know that you're already familiar with the mechanics of collaborative development. Please also briefly describe the lesson or lessons you most want to create and explain why.

## Learning Tool Developer

Using the learnr and gradethis packages, lesson developers can create interactive exercises that run in the RStudio IDE and give learners feedback on their work. In this project, you will work with RStudio’s developers and education team to extend these packages with new exercise types, add new and better ways to check answers and give feedback. Successful candidates will be fluent in R (including non-standard evaluation and package development) and familiar with either Python or JavaScript. To demonstrate these skills and your ability to work with Git and GitHub, your application needs to include a link to a package, Shiny app, or data analysis repository on GitHub. It's OK if you create something specifically for this application: we just want to know that you're already familiar with the mechanics of collaborative development. Please also briefly describe one feature that you think learnr and gradethis don’t have that you would like to add and explain why.

## Quality Assurance

Few things are as frustrating as working for hours only to find that the fault lies in your tools. In this project, you will build tests and testing infrastructure to check and maintain the quality of RStudio's tools. Successful candidates will be familiar with test automation and have some experience with R; familiarity with the Unix shell, Python, and/or JavaScript will be an asset as well. To demonstrate these skills and your ability to work with Git and GitHub, your application needs to include a link to a package, Shiny app, or data analysis repository on GitHub. It's OK if you create something specifically for this application: we just want to know that you're already familiar with the mechanics of collaborative development. Please also briefly describe some tests you have written to check the correctness of your own software and describe what errors they caught.
