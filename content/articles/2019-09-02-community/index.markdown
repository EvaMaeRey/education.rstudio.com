The R community is a special one; useRs of all ranks welcome and support new beginners as well as each other. 

# RStudio Community

[RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is a warm and welcoming online discussion forum to ask (and answer!) any questions about using R. 

# R Weekly

Following the online [R Weekly](https://rweekly.org/) newsletter is another way to keep up with the community. There you'll read about the latest package and event announcements, as well as new educational content like online tutorials and blog posts.

# Find a local user group

If you are looking to network and meet other useRs in person, try finding [your local R meet-up group](https://www.meetup.com/topics/r-project-for-statistical-computing/) and attending an event. 

If you are a member of an underrepresented gender minority (including but not limited to cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender), we strongly encourage you to join [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/about-us/). There is an R-Ladies [community slack](https://rladies-community-slack.herokuapp.com/) to help you meet other members, and there are [local chapters](https://www.meetup.com/pro/rladies) that meet in person now in over 47 countries. If there is not a chapter near you, consider joining [R-Ladies remote](https://twitter.us18.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=2ea47051e532678beaba00ee9&id=0d53e23281).
