Hello and welcome to the RStudio Education website! üéâ We hope to make [education.rstudio.com](/) a community resource for data scientists who want to [learn](/learn/) or [teach](/teach/) with RStudio's open source tools, including our [Integrated Development Environment](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) and [R packages](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rpackages/), and [enterprise-ready professional software](https://www.rstudio.com/products/). 

RStudio's mission:

> "Equip everyone, regardless of means, to participate in a global economy that rewards data literacy."

Our site includes four main sections:


+ [**Latest**.](/latest) This is the üÜï RStudio Education Team's blog. Here, we'll post announcements for events, books, and other resources as they come up, as well as general R education-related content that we are excited about sharing.

+ [**Learn**.](/learn) Our advice for how learners can expand their knowledge about R and popular packages from RStudio like `tidyverse` and Shiny. You'll find three learning pathways that detail what to learn and where to start for [beginners](/learn/#beginner), [intermediates](/learn/#intermediate), and [experts](/learn/#expert). This page may change as new resources become available and grab our attention! So rest assured, this page will be kept up-to-date, but that also means that our recommendations might change too.

+ [**Teach**.](/teach) Use our materials and evidence-based teaching practices to teach data science using R and RStudio's products.

+ [**Certify**.](https://rstd.io/trainers) This section will take you to an external site where you can find out about [RStudio's instructor training and certification program](https://rstd.io/trainers).

Who are we? We are members of RStudio's Education team. We are a small team of data scientists and professional educators. Our team is fully remote, spanning from Scotland to Oregon state. Meet each of us [here](/author/).

Our team members attend and present at workshops around the world. You can find out who will be where by checking our [upcoming events calendar](/events/). If you'll be there too, please come say hi and introduce yourself! Our team loves to talk about all things data science and education, and we'd love to meet you in person.

You can also follow our work at the [RStudio Education GitHub Organization](https://github.com/rstudio-education/). All of our work [there](https://github.com/rstudio-education/), including training materials and workshops, is openly-licensed and freely-available for reuse.
